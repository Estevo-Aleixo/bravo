This is an experimental fork of the bravo library which adds
some features and modifes some others to make it work as a
client, instead of a server.

Notable differences are that packet decoding is added to
a few classes which needed them (i dont remember all the
changes i made right now!).  The world class is modfied
slightly to not load chucks, but to get them from the
connection to the server, and a couple convience functions
added in places.

I've included a very simple script to get you started.
---but it won't run. just take a look if you need somewhere
   to start.  ^_^
